## Installation
Although this is simply a refactored webpage and no installation is necessary, there were certain criteria that had to be met in order to complete this project:

    User Story

    AS A marketing agency

    I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards

    SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

    Acceptance Criteria
    
    GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

    WHEN I view the source code

    THEN I find semantic HTML elements

    WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements

    THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

    WHEN I view the icon and image elements

    THEN I find accessible alt attributes

    WHEN I view the heading attributes

    THEN they fall in sequential order

    WHEN I view the title element

    THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
